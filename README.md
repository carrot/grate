A modern grid system for stylus.

### Why Should You Care?

You are on a mission. A mission to make responsive sites on a grid, using stylus. You have searched long and hard and found many things in your journey. First, you have found boatloads of grid systems for sass. But these are not useful. You also found the [semantic grid system](https://github.com/twigkit/semantic.gs/), which looked great, only to realize it's unmaintained. You searched github long and hard only to find a smattering of half-baked and mostly unmaintained solutions.

Good news, your search is over. Grate is a modified version of [jeet](jeetframework.com), which has had a long and tumultuous history, and sadly has not ended up in the hands of anyone who wants to maintain it. But it still contains a very solid grid framework, so we're picking up the slack, pulling out the grid, and making sure that it's useable.

### Installation

`npm install grate`

### Usage

Grate is a [stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) plugin, and can be integrated in any way that stylus plugins normally are. If you are curious how to use stylus plugins, feel free to [check out this guide](https://gist.github.com/jenius/8263065).

More docs coming soon...
