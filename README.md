A modern grid system for stylus.

### Why Should You Care?

You are on a mission. A mission to make responsive sites on a grid, using stylus. You have searched long and hard and found many things in your journey. First, you have found boatloads of grid systems for sass. But these are not useful. You also found the [semantic grid system](https://github.com/twigkit/semantic.gs/), which looked great, only to realize it's unmaintained. You searched github long and hard only to find a smattering of half-baked and mostly unmaintained solutions. Well, here you can find a solid grid framework written for stylus and watched/maintained closely.

Grate is a modified version of [jeet](http://jeetframework.com), which has been around for a while, but sadly has not ended up in the hands of anyone who wants to maintain it. We've isolated jeet's grid system here and made it available for easy use as a stylus plugin.

### Installation

`npm install grate`

### Usage

Grate is a [stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) plugin, and can be integrated in any way that stylus plugins normally are. If you are curious how to use stylus plugins, feel free to [check out this guide](https://gist.github.com/jenius/8263065).

More docs coming soon. For now, see http://jeetframework.com for basic usage and examples.
